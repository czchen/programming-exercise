# Longest Consecutive Sequence

* Given an unsorted array of integers `nums`, return __the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence__.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(n)` time.

## Constraints

* `0` <= `nums.length` <= `pow(10, 5)`
* `pow(10, -9)` <= `nums[i]` <= `pow(10, 9)`
